# Salary_LinearRegression
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict employee salaries based on years of experience. 
The model is developed from scratch using Python and foundational mathematical concepts without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The focus is on understanding the underlying mechanics of linear regression, including gradient descent optimization, cost function computation, and parameter tuning.

The project includes:

Data visualization to explore the relationship between years of experience and salary.
A cost function implementation to measure model accuracy.
Gradient descent optimization to minimize the cost and improve predictions.
Visualization of the optimization process and the final regression line.

**Features**

Data Loading: Reads salary data from a CSV file.
Data Visualization: Displays scatter plots to illustrate the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
Cost Function Implementation: Calculates the mean squared error to assess model performance.
Gradient Descent: Optimizes model parameters (w and b) through iterative updates.
Prediction and Visualization: Plots the final regression line alongside the training data.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Salary Dataset for Simple Linear Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression/data).
It consists of two columns:

Years of Experience: Independent variable (input feature).
Salary: Dependent variable (target).
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file (salary_dataset.csv) and preprocessed for training.
